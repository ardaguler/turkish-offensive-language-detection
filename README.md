This project detects offensive/abusive language in Turkish text using a **two-layer system**:

1. **Lexicon-based masking** â€“ normalizes obfuscations and masks offensive words.  
2. **Contextual classification (BERTurk)** â€“ fine-tuned `dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased` model for detecting abusive context.
